            " I've been to the other Federal Donuts location multiple times. I love donuts, and coffee and this place does both very well. The South Philly location is so small, and I often find myself cramped while in there. However, the donuts are always amazing, which keeps me coming back for more and more. I recently visited the Center City location - and found that they had a better handle on crowd control, which I appreciated. The donuts were just as good as what I had tried in the past - specifically, I had the green tea sesame which I could have bathed in vats of. I ate all the little crumbly pieces that had fallen off into the bag when I got home. That's how good they are. Both hot and fancy, really in any variety are always amazing. Try them all!\n",

They LOADED the mustard, but that really wasn't what I didn't like about it. It really wasn't that I disliked the burger, it just wasn't anywhere near one of the best burgers that I've had. The extra toppings at fifty cents each are pretty skimpy too. I was a fan of the wasabi aioli though. I also loved the tater tots though. I highly recommend ordering tater tots over the french fries. The beer cheese dipping sauce was an extra dollar and was borderline disgusting. Stick with wasabi aioli. \n",
